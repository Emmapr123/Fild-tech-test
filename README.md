## Carousel

![preview](./assets/voorbeeld_fild.png)

This is a carousel component as it could be used in an app. 
I built this for mobile use, not for web.

To use:
- clone this repo
- run yarn or npm install
- run expo start and pick i to open an ios simulator

Or scan this QR code to see it on you own device  (You do need the expo go app for this)
